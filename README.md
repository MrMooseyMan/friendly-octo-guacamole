**Anything goes. Seriously.**

This is my personal playground repository where I build whatever I want, whenever I want. No rules, no structure, just vibes.

## What is this?

A sandbox for random projects, experiments, and ideas that pop into my head. I work on this mostly from **Cursor Mobile** when I'm bored on the couch or have a few minutes to kill.

## What might you find here?

- 🎮 Games
- 🌐 Websites
- 📱 Apps
- 🧪 Experiments
- 🤖 Random scripts
- 💡 Whatever I feel like building

## Philosophy

- No planning required
- No commitments
- Ship fast, break things
- Learn by doing
- Have fun
