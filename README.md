**Anything goes. Seriously.**

This is my personal playground repository where I build whatever the hell I want, whenever I'm bored. Most of the time I'm hacking on this from my couch using Cursor Mobile.

## What's in here?

No structure. No rules. Just vibes. You might find:

- 🎮 **Games** - random game ideas, experiments, prototypes
- 📱 **Apps** - mobile apps, web apps, CLI tools
- 🌐 **Websites** - landing pages, weird sites, useful tools
- 🧪 **Experiments** - trying out new tech, APIs, frameworks
- 📜 **Scripts** - utility scripts, automations, one-offs

## Philosophy

- **Speed over perfection** - get it working first
- **Fun over production-ready** - this isn't enterprise software
- **Creativity over consistency** - every project is its own thing
- **Mobile-first workflow** - built from wherever I happen to be

## Tech Stack

Whatever fits the moment. Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, Rust, Go... if it solves the problem, it's in.
