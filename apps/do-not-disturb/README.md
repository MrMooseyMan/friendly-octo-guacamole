# Do Not Disturb 🔴🟢

A simple "fuck off button" app for when you need to go dark for a while.

## What is this?

It's a digital status indicator — like a traffic light for your availability:

- **🟢 Green** = Available. Text me, call me, whatever!
- **🔴 Red** = Going dark. I'm alive and well, but I'm not responding right now.

## Features

### Status Toggle
One big button to switch between "Available" and "Do Not Disturb" mode.

### Dark Mode (The "I Need a Break" State)
When you go dark, the app shows:
- A clear message that you're **alive and well** (so people don't worry)
- Your configured **emergency contact** info (for actual emergencies)
- An explanation that you're taking a break and will return

### Message Vault
When in dark mode, visitors can leave messages for you. These get stored in your "vault" and you can read them later when you come back.

### Settings
Click the ⚙️ gear icon to customize:
- Your name
- Emergency contact information

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any browser
2. Click ⚙️ to set your name and emergency contact
3. Click "Go Dark" when you need a break
4. Click "Come Back" when you're ready to be available again
5. Check the Message Vault to see what people sent while you were away

## Storage

Everything is saved locally in your browser's localStorage. Your state persists across page reloads — so if you go dark and close the tab, you'll still be dark when you come back.

## Use Case

Perfect for:
- Post-holiday decompression
- Mental health breaks
- "I just need a few days" moments
- When you're fine but just don't want to talk to anyone

It's not about being antisocial — it's about setting healthy boundaries while letting people know you're okay.
