# Wild Dot Crawler

A tiny turn-based dungeon crawler.

## How to play

- **Move**: Arrow keys / WASD (or use the on-screen D‑pad)
- **Goal**: find the **stairs** (green) to go deeper
- **Loot**: **gems** give score, **hearts** heal you
- **Enemies**: they move after you. If you step into one, you attack instead.

## Run it
