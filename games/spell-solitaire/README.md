Classic Klondike Solitaire with a magical twist — **spells**!

## 🎮 How to Play

Open `index.html` in your browser and start playing!

### Basic Rules (Klondike Solitaire)

1. **Goal**: Move all 52 cards to the four foundation piles, building each suit from Ace to King.
2. **Tableau**: Build piles in descending order (K → Q → J → 10...), alternating colors (red on black, black on red).
3. **Empty Spaces**: Only Kings can be placed in empty tableau columns.
4. **Stock Pile**: Click to draw cards to the waste pile. When empty, click to recycle.
5. **Double-click**: Auto-move a card to its foundation if valid.

## ✨ The Twist: Spells!

Every valid move earns you **mana** (✨). Spend mana to cast powerful spells that give you an edge:

| Spell | Cost | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| 👁️ **Peek** | 15 | Click any face-down card to reveal it for 2 seconds |
| ⏪ **Undo** | 10 | Take back your last move |
| 💡 **Hint** | 5 | Highlights a valid move you can make |
| 🃏 **Wild** | 50 | Your next card placement ignores the color rule! |
| 🌟 **Reveal** | 30 | See ALL face-down cards for 3 seconds |

### Mana Earnings

- Regular move: **+3 mana**
- Move to foundation: **+10 mana**
- Flip a face-down card: **+2 mana**

## 🎯 Strategy Tips

1. **Save mana for emergencies** — The Wild spell can save a stuck game!
2. **Use Hint early** — At just 5 mana, it's cheap and helps you learn.
3. **Peek before committing** — Knowing what's hidden helps you plan moves.
4. **Reveal for planning** — 30 mana for 3 seconds of omniscience is worth it in tough spots.
