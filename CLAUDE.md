# CLAUDE.md - AI Context for friendly-octo-guacamole

## What is this repo?

This is a personal sandbox/playground repository. The owner builds random projects here whenever they're bored, mostly from Cursor Mobile on the couch.

## Key Context for AI Assistants

### Vibe
- **Anything goes** - no restrictions on what can be built
- **Speed > perfection** - prioritize getting things working quickly
- **Fun > production-ready** - this isn't enterprise software
- **Mobile workflow** - the owner usually works from Cursor Mobile

### What gets built here
- Games (browser games, simple game experiments)
- Apps (web apps, tools, utilities)
- Websites (landing pages, fun sites)
- Experiments (trying new tech, APIs, frameworks)
- Scripts (one-offs, automations)

### Tech preferences
- Any stack is fair game
- Prefer simple, self-contained projects
- Single-file solutions are great when possible
- Dependencies are fine but don't over-engineer

### Suggested folder structure (optional, not enforced)
```
/games/       - game projects
/apps/        - applications and tools
/websites/    - web pages and sites
/experiments/ - tech experiments and prototypes
/scripts/     - utility scripts and one-offs
```

### When building new projects
1. Ask what the owner wants to build
2. Suggest the simplest approach that works
3. Get something working fast
4. Iterate if they want more features
5. Keep it fun!

### Code style
- Readable over clever
- Comments when helpful
- Don't over-engineer
- It's okay if it's scrappy

## Remember
This repo is for creativity and fun. Don't overthink it. Just build cool stuff! 🥑
