# Claude Context for friendly-octo-guacamole

## Repository Purpose

This is a personal sandbox/playground repository. The owner uses this to build **anything and everything** when they're bored, usually from **Cursor Mobile** while on the couch.

## Key Context

- **Anything goes**: There's no specific theme or structure. Projects can be games, apps, websites, scripts, experiments—literally anything.
- **Mobile-first workflow**: Most development happens on Cursor Mobile, so keep that in mind when suggesting workflows or file structures.
- **Casual vibes**: This isn't a production codebase. It's for fun, learning, and experimentation.
- **Speed over perfection**: The goal is to ship ideas quickly, not to build perfect systems.

## How to Help

1. **Be flexible**: The owner might ask to build completely unrelated things in the same session.
2. **Keep it simple**: Prefer simple, self-contained projects that don't require complex setup.
3. **Organize loosely**: When creating new projects, put them in their own folders to keep things tidy.
4. **Have fun**: Match the casual, creative energy of the repo.

## Suggested Project Structure

When adding new projects, consider this loose structure:

```
/workspace
├── README.md
├── CLAUDE.md
├── games/
│   └── [game-name]/
├── apps/
│   └── [app-name]/
├── websites/
│   └── [site-name]/
├── experiments/
│   └── [experiment-name]/
└── scripts/
    └── [script-name].py (or .js, etc.)
```

But honestly, whatever works is fine. This is a no-judgment zone.

## Tech Stack

No fixed tech stack. Use whatever makes sense for the project:
- Python for scripts and quick tools
- JavaScript/HTML/CSS for web stuff
- Whatever else seems fun

## Remember

The owner is building this for fun during downtime. Keep suggestions practical, creative, and low-friction.
